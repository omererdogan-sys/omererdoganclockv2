How did research influence you answer..
From the 3 different type of clocks I found, a weightlike clock, a religious clock and a moon like clock, I kind of combined all them with deep meaning. For example weight represented discipline and the such, religious one was divided between both, a night time as it has a sacred part and the moon represented slower activities and getting ready for sleep and the such.

What was the most challenging part?
The most challenging part was setting the crescent moon properly. But because it was hard but for it to be aestetic it had to have a good ratio which was reached by trial and error.

If I had more time I would want to add more segments to the clock and make it like 0.00, 01.15 etc. and wouldve put symbols representing the work thats needed to be done at that time I think.
